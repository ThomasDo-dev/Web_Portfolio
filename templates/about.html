    <h1>Hey, I'm Thomas ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m the kind of person who gets a thrill from making things workâ€”whether itâ€™s turning code into a smooth-running app, ensuring a circuit board hums just right, or chasing the excitement of something being perfectly designed the first time. I design hardware, write firmware, and build full-stack applications because Iâ€™m addicted to creating systems that just work.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things, try out new experiences, and meet people who share that same passion for growth. When Iâ€™m not elbow-deep in soldering irons or debugging code, youâ€™ll probably find me with a camera in hand (filmmaking geek here) or swinging a golf club (poorly, but hey, I try).</p>

    <p>If you want to chat tech, collaborate on something exciting, or swap golf tips, letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™m always ready to learn and create something awesome.</p>
